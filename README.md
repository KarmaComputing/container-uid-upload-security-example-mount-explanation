# docker apache php file write directory docker-compose

Basic image php + apache + write to file, working, with mounted uploads directory, note the difference is:

1. create uploads directory on your **host** machine (outside the container)
2. mkdir uploads; # See it's in the .gitignore file (we don't want to store user data in a repo, nor in a container
3. Change the ownership of your **host** folder called `uploads` to the same user `id` of the user in the container
   for this example, the user is www-data, and that user's id is `33`. How to find out? exec inside the container and
   type `id www-data` , it will tell you the user id.
3. Run the container with the mount: `docker run -v $PWD/uploads:/var/www/html/uploads -p 8081:80 test`
   now the index.php script will be able to write to your local 'uploads' folder http://127.0.0.1:8081

In summary: `chown` your local `uploads` directory on your local machine to the same id as the id used in the container.

Why is there for docker-compose.yml? It's the same settings as `docker run` just in yaml, Pull requests welcome :) 


# Explanation

- Decide to store uploaded filed outside the container in a folder on the host
- This creates a challange because ownership permissions are not in sync
  - To be exact, the user namespace (user id) of the process running 'in the container' is different
    from the host, so when the process tries to write to the files, the owner `id` is the host machine,
    not the container's process id owner.
- There's no such thing as a process running 'in a container' really, it's running on the host, within a namespace,
  so it's seperated
- ? Security question: So does this mean that if my roo user `id` is `33` and my container has a user which also has the
   user `id` `33`, can the container read the root filesystem? yes. ðŸŽƒ.  If by mistake, a user id in a container is the same as a real user id on the host, it can be big trouble. 
   
   This is why some container ecosystems (e.g. Openshift eforce containers always have a user id > greater than 10000, (and random) to reduce the risk of the user id used in a container is never the same id as a user on the host machine.

Bash history, keep checking `ps` and `ls -l` to validate 
ownership is correct
